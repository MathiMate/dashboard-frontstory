A React-based UI that displays a list of campaigns in a table format.
Each campaign should have:
Name âœ…
Start & End Date âœ…
Clicks âœ…
Cost âœ…
Revenue âœ…
Profit (Revenue - Cost) âœ…
Users should be able to:
Add a new campaign via a form. âœ…
Delete a campaign from the list. âœ…
See calculated profit per campaign dynamically. âœ…

Implement basic styling for a clean UI. âœ…
Allow sorting campaigns by name, date, or profit. âœ…

After that, I moved on to the top cards to display the total number of clicks, costs, etc.

I added a friendly message for the user in case there are no campaigns to display.

And finally, I built the dashboard to show the requested data.
